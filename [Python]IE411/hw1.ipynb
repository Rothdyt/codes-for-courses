    "* For week 1, suppose there is no inventory of Swiss cheese and sharp cheese. Then even if all workers work fully on producing the two types of cheese, they can not meet the demand ($11000/10 + 8000/6 > 60 * 40$). So we assume there are $r_{01}, r_{02}\\geq 0$, which represents surplus from previous production activity.\n",

    "* The cheese produced at the beginning of the week $i$ is regarded as equivalent to those produced at the end of the week $i$ in terms of the time, which means they can be used to fulfill the following one week's demand. \n",
