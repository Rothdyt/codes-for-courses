2018-11-09 00:06:05,321 - [INFO] - i love this movie . absolutely dreadful , such as falling on a river street on sight sets . for me this film the second lover of bloody mary , after being raped , serves in the end of the movie . i too loved throughout the movie . the movie is classic , though this was one of the best experiences reading the book . first view was , i had n't have seen the maniac rape it because i wished she had a chance to show what maria had to decide her son . `` one day man '' i expected an answer : i do n't know , but it was not outside and stupid . i saw the rain two times , and the beginning jumped from a rental at the beginning . i guess it 's reason for my own punishment especially to locate how week a $ 10 dollars 
2018-11-09 00:06:05,322 - [INFO] - i hate this movie . i felt sorry for the people who liked these movies ( and twins , catholic ) and it was nice to see the incredibly big pop culture reviews . more importantly , it 's unfair to see a movie like this that stays , because of its special effects , but the ending is determined to tie up great acting . the only thing this movie does is get an actor who plays the tough evil killer clown , an inner relative of revenge . or sorry because i think the king 's speech comes under polanski 's face without disguise . it 's so rarely even annoying to watch . i expected it to be interesting and fun , and that i liked it along with the resulting first half of the movie . this movie had too much gore . it 's one of those style that movie
