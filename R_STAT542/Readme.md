# Description
This fold contains important algorithms discussed in the STAT542(Statistical Learning). All algorithms are written in R, using base functions.

Algorithms:
- Adaboost (Using stump classifier)
- Coordinate Descent solving the lasso problem (Gaussian Data/CV method provided)
- SVM (Linear Kernel for seperable and non-seperable cases/ CV method provided)
- Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression (Gaussian Kernel)
